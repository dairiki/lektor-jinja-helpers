# Lektor-jinja-helpers

This is a [Lektor plugin] that adds an assortment of filters, tests,
and globals to Lektor’s Jinja environment.

These additions are hopefully useful in Lektor templates.

## “Namespacing”

To avoid namespace pollution, currently, all of the bits added to the
jinja environment by this plugin are added under the `helpers`
namespace. That is, all the names of these filters, tests and globals
start with `helpers.`

## Jinja Filters

### helpers.adjust\_heading\_levels(html\_text, demote=0, normalize=True)

This filter expects HTML text as input. It can be used both to
normalize the HTML heading hierarchy in the text, as well as to
“demote” the heading levels by a fixed amount.

This is useful when, e.g., a [markdown field] is to be included on a
page that already has some heading. E.g. the following template would
ensure that the headings with `div.markdown-body` start correctly at
`<h2>`.

```j2
<main>
  <h1>{{ this.title }}</h1>
  <div class="markdown-body">
  {{ this.body | helpers.adjust_heading_levels(demote=1) }}
  <div>
</main>
```

First (by default) it normalizes the HTML heading levels in the text, so that:

- The first heading is always `<h1>`.

- There are no "gaps" in the heading hierarchy: for every heading of
  depth greater than `<h1>` there will exist a parent heading of the
  preceding level. E.g. for every `<h3>` in the normalized text, there
  will be an extant `<h2>` parent preceding it.

This normalization may be prevented by passing `normalize=false` to
the filter.

Then, optionally, the filter *demotes* (increases the level) of each
heading by a fixed amount. The value of the `demote` argument
specifies the number of levels the headings are to be increased.

Headings are never demoted below `<h6>`. This is because `<h7>` is not
a valid HTML5 element. Instead, an [aria-level] attribute is set on
deeply demoted headings: in place of `<h7>`, an `<h6 aria-level="7">`
is used.

### helpers.excerpt\_html(html\_text, min\_words=50, cut\_mark=r"(?i)\s*more\b")

This filter expects HTML text as input and returns a possibly truncated
version of that text. It truncates the input in one of two ways:

1. This function first looks for an HTML comment whose text matches
   the regular expression **cut-mark**. (The default value matches
   comments beginning with the word “more”.) If such a comment is
   found, all text after that comment is deleted, and the result is
   returned. The truncation is done in an HTML-aware manner. The
   result will be a valid HTML fragment: it will not contain dangling
   tags, etc.

   Passing `cut_mark=none` will disable the search for a cut-mark.

2. If no cut-mark is found, then the text is truncated at the first
   block element such that there are at least ``min_words`` words in
   the preserved (preceding) text.

If no suitable truncation point can be found, the original text is returned.

This filter provides a thin wrapper around the [excerpt-html] library.


### helpers.call(function, \*args, \*\*kwargs)

This helper can be used to convert a global function to a [jinja
filter]. This is primarily useful when one would like to use a global
function in a [`map`][map filter] filter.

As a contrived example

```j2
{% for r in range(3) | map("helpers.call", range, 4) -%}
  {{ r | join(",") }}
{% endfor -%}
```

will produce

```
0,1,2,3
1,2,3
2,3
```

## Jinja Tests

### helpers.call(function, \*args, \*\*kwargs)

`Helpers.call` can also be used to convert a global function to a
Jinja test.  This is useful when one would like to use a global
function in a [`select`][select filter] filter or one of its
relatives.

Another contrived example:

```j2
{% set isupper = "".__class__.isupper -%}
{{ ["lower", "UPPER"] | select("helpers.call", isupper) | join(",") }}
```

will produce `"UPPER"`.

## Jinja Globals

### helpers.import\_module(name, package=none)

[`Importlib.import_module`][import-module] from the Python standard library is made available to Jinja templates as `helpers.import_module`. This foot-gun allows access to nearly any python value from within a template.

E.g., to access the current date

```j2
{% set date = helpers.import_module("datetime").date -%}
{{ date.now().isoformat() }}
```

## Ideas / To Do


- Perhaps the *namespacing* of all new features under the `helpers.`
  prefix should be made configurable.

- It would be nice to avoid the weight of [BeautifulSoup4] and
  [html5lib] if possible.  (But note that [excerpt-html] currently
  uses both of those libraries.)
